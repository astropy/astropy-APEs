Abstract
--------

This document and APE grew out of discussion at the April 2015 Lorentz Center
meeting on Python in Astronomy, prompted both by meetings involving a
substantial group from this community, as well as the addition of commenting
capabilities to the Astropy Tutorials page.  We believe that our community has
developed to the point that we should have a code of conduct specific to the
Astropy project (and other projects of similar mind).  This APE provides the
text of just such a code of conduct, which will be adopted by the project to
provide guidance to the community. The code of conduct will be licensed using
the Creative Commons Attribution license, allowing other projects to use this
code or adapt it to their needs.

Notice of Replacement
---------------------

As of 2026, the Astropy Community Code of Conduct is superceded by the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct, which can be found at https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/. The NumFOCUS Code of Conduct is available at https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct, and while different in detailed language, shares the same core principles and in general is the same as the Code of Conduct described here.  This APE is retained for reference and use by others, but is no longer the active code of conduct for the Astropy community. For more details on the transition, see https://github.com/astropy/astropy.github.com/pull/669 and linked mailing list posts and related issues.


Detailed description

The text of the code of conduct is shown here:

Astropy Community Code of Conduct
=================================

The community of participants in open source Astronomy projects is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

* We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
* We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.
* We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.
* We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in discussion threads resulting from code contributions.
* We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.
* We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code such as contacting confidential@astropy.org (all emails sent to this address will be treated with the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the `PSF code of conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_.

Branches and pull requests
--------------------------

* `astropy.github.com#75 <https://github.com/astropy/astropy.github.com/pull/75>`_: adds the Code of Conduct to the astropy web site.


Implementation
--------------

If this APE is accepted, the code of conduct shown above will be added to the
astropy.org web site.  Note that this is *not* intended to mean that the text
cannot be revised in the future. After this APE is accepted, the authoritative
copy of the code of conduct will be the one on the web site, so future changes
can be made using pull requests to that version.  However, any such pull
requests should be advertised to the community via standard communication
channels like the mailing lists, allowing at least one week for feedback from
the community.



Backward compatibility
----------------------

None.


Alternatives
------------

None.


Decision rationale
------------------

This APE was discussed extensively in person at the Python in Astronomy
workshop, so the version proposed in this APE was already close to final.
Only a few minor changes were made during the APE review process, and in
particular a clause was added that future changes to the code of conduct do
not require a new APE, but do require a period of one week for anyone to
raise objections to proposed changes. No objections were raised for this APE,
and it was therefore accepted on May 17th 2015.
