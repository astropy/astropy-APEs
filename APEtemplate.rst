APE Purpose and Process
-----------------------

author: <your name>

date: <date the APE was submitted>

type: <one of these three: Standard Track, Informational, Process>

status: Discussion

Abstract
--------

The abstract should be a short description of what the APE will achieve.

Detailed description
--------------------

This section describes the need for the APE.  It should describe the existing
problem that it is trying to solve and why this APE makes the situation better.
It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used and
perhaps some use cases.

Branches and Pull requests
--------------------------

Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this APE should be
linked to from here.  (An APE does not need to be implemented in a single pull
request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases). If no code is yet
implemented, just put "N/A"

Implementation
--------------

This section lists the major steps required to implement the APE.  Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which
steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes sense, each  step should
include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.


Backward compatibility
----------------------

This section describes the ways in which the APE breaks backward compatibility.

Alternatives
------------

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should
be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.

Decision Rationale
------------------

<To be filled in when the APE is accepted or rejected>
