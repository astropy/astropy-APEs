APEs: Astropy Proposals for Enhancement
---------------------------------------

APEs are documents to address non-trivial enhancements that require discussion
and thought beyond a single Pull Request. This is intended to mirror the
long-standing Python Enhancement  Proposal process, but generally not quite as
formally. Normally a proposal goes through various phases of consideration.
Discussion is expected to take place using existing mechanisms (astropy-dev,
github, hangouts, etc), and eventually a decision is made regarding whether the
proposal should be accepted, rejected, or modified.

Proposing a new APE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New APEs should be created using the ``APEtemplate.rst`` file in this repository.
Fork the repository, copy ``APEtemplate.rst`` to
``APE_<some_working_name>.rst`` and issue a Pull Request with that file once
you've written it up (little explanation is required in the PR itself given that
the document has all the content - usually it's easiest to just paste in the
abstract). The APE number will be assigned once the PR is merged.

Note that there is not much point to making proposals unless someone or some
group has signed up to implement it if the APE is accepted
(typically this would involve the author or authors of the APE).  Just issuing
an APE in order to spur others to do work is not generally going to be received
well. Generally, an implementation is expected before an APE can be considered
fully accepted. For proposals that require extensive work that few are willing
to perform without some assurance it will be accepted, provisional acceptance
is an option. For serious consideration it is usually good to show that detailed
technical aspects have been played with in real code rather (even if it isn't a
complete implementation).

Finalizing APEs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The final decision on accepting or rejecting APEs lies with the Astropy
Coordination Committee.  Once the community discussion on the APE has wound
down, the committee discusses the APE and makes a final decision on acceptance
or rejection.  One of the committee members should then:

1. Fill in the "Decision rationale" section of the APE with a description of why
   the APE was accepted or rejected, including a summary of the community's
   discussion as relevant.
2. Update the "date-last-revised" to the day of merging and "status" to
   "Accepted" or "Rejected".
3. If necessary, rename the APE file to be ``APE##.rst``, where ## is the next
   free number on the list of APEs.
#. Leave a brief comment in the PR indicating the result.
#. Merge the PR with the above changes.
#. If the APE was accepted then continue with the remaining steps, otherwise stop now.
#. Upload the APE to Zenodo to give it a DOI.  Go to https://zenodo.org/deposit/new, upload
   the .rst file, and set the fields to the following:

   ============================= ======================================================
   Zenodo field                  Set to
   ============================= ======================================================
   Communities                   The Astropy Project
   Upload type                   Publication
   Publication type              Technical note
   Publication Date              The date-last-revised of the APE (which should be the same as the accepted date for new APEs)
   Title                         Astropy Proposal for Enhancement <number>: <title> (APE <number>)
   Authors                       The APE authors (directly from the APE text, but with ORCIDs if possible)
   Description                   The APE abstract (copy/paste the rendered HTML from GitHub)
   License                       CC-Attribution (default)
   Related/alternate identifiers Github link to the APE file *at the specific merge commit* (e.g. https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/42951733ac42c0ea178d8df30705274a43c93091/APE1.rst) as "is supplemented by this upload". If this is a revised version, this should be the URL of the commit where the APE was revised.
   ============================= ======================================================

#. Get the source for the DOI badge from the newly-created Zenodo record page by
   clicking on the DOI badge on the right side of the page and copying the
   reStructuredText source. You will need to update that with the "all versions"
   DOI number, which you can see under the "versions" section of Zenodo. (It is
   typically the first version minus 1.)
#. On GitHub (or locally) edit ``README.rst`` and add an entry for the new APE to the
   "Accepted APEs" table.  Use the DOI link from the previous step.  Add
   corresponding RST link refs for both the DOI link and the new APE.  Preview
   the update and test the links to make sure they are all correct.  Then commit
   directly to main (or PR if you prefer).
#. Send an email to `astropy-dev <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astropy-dev/>`_
   announcing the acceptance In general this should just point to the accepted
   APE rather than providing additional decision rationale.

Updating APEs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the cases where an updated APE requires updating (e.g. references to a  new
APE that supercedes it, clarifying information that emerges after the APE is
accepted, etc.), changes can be made directly via PR, but the
"date-last-revised" should be updated in the APE. Additionally, the Zenodo entry
will need to be updated with a new version of the APE (*not* a completely new
Zenodo entry), by using the "New version" button and then filling out the forms
as described above.


If you locally cloned this repo before 10 Mar 2021
--------------------------------------------------

The primary branch for this repo has been transitioned from ``master`` to ``main``.  If you have a local clone of this repository and want to keep your local branch in sync with this repo, you'll need to do the following in your local clone from your terminal::

   git fetch --all --prune
   # you can stop here if you don't use your local "master"/"main" branch
   git branch -m master main
   git branch -u origin/main main

If you are using a GUI to manage your repos you'll have to find the equivalent commands as it's different for different programs. Alternatively, you can just delete your local clone and re-clone!
