Abstract
========
This APE defines the formal fundamental governance process for the Astropy
Project. The Astropy Project broadly follows the philosophy of do-ocracy:
project participants who gain experience and knowledge through sustained
community contributions and have demonstrated adherence to core principles of
inclusion and consensus-building will be entrusted with increasing levels of
authority. This peaks with the Coordination Committee, which has relatively
broad authority but seeks to exercise it as rarely as possible by working
towards consensus. This is because at its core, the Project is both by and for
its community, and therefore the community is the final source of authority and
direction.

Detailed Description
====================
The Governance Charter is described in this section. The initial version is the
outcome of several months of discussion by the Astropy Governance Working Group,
which aimed to both codify existing informal governance rules as well as update
them with new ideas that are consistent with the philosophy of and vision for
the Astropy project.

Ultimate Authority: The Astropy Community
-----------------------------------------
The Astropy Project derives its authority from the whole community - developers,
users, and even potential participants in the broader astronomical and
scientific software community. All have a vested interest in the success of the
Project, so all governance in the end belongs to this community in its entirety.
The governance Charter described below provides levels of delegation of that
authority, particularly to the `Voting Members`_ and the
Coordination Committee.

.. _`Voting Member`: #the-voting-members

The Coordination Committee
--------------------------

Composition
^^^^^^^^^^^
The Coordination Committee is a committee that is composed of five
members (this number was decided by vote at the same time as the first
Coordination Committee election).
The Ombudsperson (described in
Section 4) and the Coordination Committee will work to maintain this composition
following the processes laid out in this Charter.

Role
^^^^
The Coordination Committee’s role is to facilitate consensus in the Project and
coordinate Project-spanning efforts. As such, the Coordination Committee shall
work to:

* Maintain the quality and stability of the Astropy ecosystem of packages for
  the community,
* Facilitate the development of resources that improve accessibility and
  understanding of the Astropy ecosystem,
* Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible,
* Oversee the financial and legal status of the project,
* Lead and oversee the decision-making process for APEs and other community
  decisions,
* Seek consensus among the Astropy community, particularly before acting in a
  formal capacity,
* Act as the decision-making body where all other methods for achieving
  consensus have failed,
* Operate openly and provide transparency and opportunity for community input
  into its activities,
* Act as a point of contact with other organizations.

Responsibilities and Authority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Coordination Committee has broad authority to make decisions about the
Project. For example, they can:

* Accept or reject APEs and updates to APEs (except this one - see below),
* Enforce or update the Project's code of conduct,
* Manage any project assets (including financial and physical assets),
* Delegate parts of their authority to other subcommittees or processes.

However, they cannot modify the Governance of the Project (i.e., this document),
except during the initial adoption of this Charter as specified herein.

While the Coordination Committee has broad authority, it has the responsibility
to work towards consensus whenever practical. The Coordination Committee
should look for ways to use its authority as little as possible, striving
to involve the community in decisions whenever possible, and delegating
responsibilities.

When delegating its authority by creating roles or making appointments, the
Coordination Committee must solicit community feedback for no less than two
weeks.

Making Decisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use its authority, the Coordination Committee must first attempt to reach
a consensus. If a consensus cannot be reached, the Committee votes. Every
Coordination Committee member must either vote or explicitly abstain. Members
with a conflict of interest on a particular vote must abstain. The final
decision regarding what constitutes a conflict of interest is determined by the
Ombudsperson in accordance with the conflict of interest policy. Passing
decisions require a strict majority of non-abstaining Coordination Committee
members.

Whenever possible, the Coordination Committee's deliberations shall be held in
public in a manner that permits discussion and comments from the community.
Final decisions made by the Coordination Committee will be published in a
publicly visible location.

Electing the Coordination Committee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Coordination Committee election is held annually to fill any vacant seats.
Notice of the election must be posted via the Project’s standard communication
channels for users, contributors and voting members, at least one month before
the voting phase begins. The election consists of two phases, each lasting at
least two weeks:

* Phase 1, Nominations: Candidates will be nominated and confirm their interest
  in serving. Candidates can be nominated by anyone, including themselves, and
  do not have to be `Voting Members`_ to be nominated.
  Candidates should provide a brief statement in support of their candidacy,
  these statements should be made public as they are received during the
  nominations period.
* Phase 2, Voting: Each `Voting Member`_ can vote for zero or
  more of the candidates, up to the number of candidates. Voting is performed
  anonymously. Candidates who receive votes from a majority of the voting
  members participating in the election are ranked by the total number of votes
  they receive. If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement among
  the candidates, or else the winner will be chosen at random.

The election process is managed by a Returns Officer nominated by
the outgoing Coordination Committee, although the process (specific choice of
website, etc) can be set up by the Coordination Committee or their delegates.
For the initial election, the Returns Officer will be nominated by the NumFOCUS
Executive Officer. Elections will be carried out every year, provided that at
least one of the Coordination Committee members has reached the end of their
term or decided to step down.

Term
^^^^
Each Coordination Committee member's term runs for three years from when
the election results are finalized. After serving a full term, a Coordination
Committee member must step down for at least one year before being eligible to
run again.

In the case of a vacancy partway through a term, a by-election will be held.
The term of the newly-elected member runs for the remainder of the term of
the member they are replacing.

For the initial election of Coordination Committee members, two seats will have
terms of one year, two have a term of two years, and one has a term of three
years to create a staggered set of replacements and provide continuity in the
Coordination Committee. The candidate with the largest number of votes gets the
longest available seat and the smallest the shortest, unless the new committee
mutually agree to a different allocation.

Vacancies
^^^^^^^^^
Coordination Committee members may resign their position at any time.

Whenever there is a vacancy during the regular Coordination Committee term an
election must take place.

If a Coordination Committee member cannot be contacted for longer than two
months without prior notification (for example, due to planned leave), then the
rest of the Coordination Committee may vote to trigger a by-election to replace
them for the duration of their term.

Removing Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In exceptional circumstances, the `Voting Members`_ may remove
one or more sitting Coordination Committee members via a single vote.

Such a vote is triggered when a `Voting Member`_ calls for one
publicly on an appropriate Project-wide communication channel, and two other
active Voting Members second the proposal.

For Coordination Committee Member(s) to be removed, two-thirds of the active
`Voting Members`_ (where the count *includes* the member being
voted on if they are a voting member) must vote in support of the removal.

To avoid repeated removal votes, any individual `Voting Member`_
who has called for, or seconded such a vote, may not call for or second a vote
to remove any Coordination Committee member for one year from the original
motion.

The Ombudsperson
----------------
The Ombudsperson represents the interests of the Astropy community by providing
an alternative point of contact for sensitive issues such as code of conduct
violations and ethical concerns. Candidates for this project role are publicly
nominated by the Coordination Committee, after which the Coordination Committee
allows at least two weeks for comment, and then the nominee must be confirmed by
two-thirds of the active `Voting Members`_.

The Ombudsperson has no term limit but can resign at any time, or be removed by
the same process as being confirmed: the Coordination Committee initiates, there
is a two-week comment period, and two-thirds of the active
`Voting Members`_ have to approve the removal. In the period
between removal/resignation and new appointment, the Coordination Committee will
temporarily take over the responsibilities of the Ombudsperson, should the need
arise.

The Voting Members
------------------

Role
^^^^
The Voting Members are the group of trusted individuals who operate the Astropy
Project on behalf of the community. They have authority over the Astropy
Project’s technical resources, including the Astropy Project website itself, the
Astropy GitHub organization and repositories, the issue tracker, and all Astropy
communication channels. In practice, much of this authority is passed to the
Coordination Committee via the voting processes described in this Charter.

They also assume many roles required to achieve the Project's goals, especially
those that require a high level of trust. Collectively, they make decisions that
shape the future of the Project.

Voting Members are expected to act as role models for the community and
custodians of the Project, on behalf of the community and all those who rely on
Astropy. They will act as representatives of the Astropy Project, where
necessary, including in online discussions or at official Astropy events.

Responsibilities and Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voting Members may and should participate in formal votes on:

1. Adding new Voting Members
2. Electing Coordination Committee members
3. Appointment of the Ombudsperson
4. Removing Voting Members
5. Removing Coordination Committee members
6. Removing the Ombudsperson
7. Changes to this Charter
8. Other matters for which the Coordination Committee believes a vote is
   appropriate.

The mechanism, timeline, and criteria for a decisive vote are specified in the
respective sections of this document in the first seven cases and by the
Coordination Committee in the last case.

Membership
^^^^^^^^^^
Voting Members of the Astropy Project must demonstrate all of the following:

* A good grasp of the philosophy of the Astropy Project
* A solid track record of being constructive and helpful
* Significant contributions to the Project's goals, in any form
* A willingness to dedicate time to improving the Project
* A willingness to recruit, train, and nominate new team members

Voting Membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well
with the philosophy and the goals of the Astropy Project.

Initial Membership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone who satisfies any of the following criteria at the date of acceptance of
this APE will be invited to be in the first group of Voting Members:

* Has a named role in the project and has participated in an Astropy
  coordination meeting in the last two years,
* Has a named role in the project and has participated at least four times in
  one or more of the following Astropy telecons in the last two years prior to
  the acceptance of this APE, based on available meeting minutes or confirmation
  from telecon organizers: core package developer telecons, co-working telecons,
  infrastructure telecons, proposal-related telecons, and Astropy Learn
  telecons,
* Has commit rights to at least one repository in the Astropy GitHub
  organization which is either the core package, a coordinated package,
  an infrastructure package, or an Astropy Learn-related repository,
  and has actively used those commit rights in the last two years prior to the
  acceptance of this APE.

Add New Voting Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone can be nominated as a Voting Member by providing evidence of meeting the
requirements laid out in the Membership section above. Both self-nominations and
nominations by others are allowed. The Voting Members are expected to make their
decisions based on the candidate’s adherence to the membership criteria, above.
The name of the nominee will be known to Voting Members but will not be shared
outside Voting Members and the Coordination Committee unless the nominee becomes
a Voting Member.

The procedure for voting to add new Voting Members is:

* The Coordination Committee and Ombudsperson receive each nomination, check
  that it is factually accurate, that the nominated person accepts the
  nomination, and that their record of community activity adheres to the Code of
  Conduct. If the candidate accepts, they should provide a brief statement in
  support of their nomination.
* Once a nomination is accepted by the Coordination Committee, it will be put it
  to a vote among active Voting Members. Votes for adding voting members will be
  carried out at most twice a year to avoid too many elections. The returns
  officer for the voting member election can be a voting member, and those
  officer are entitled to vote in the election.
* The voting dates will be announced with at least four weeks notice,
  and additional nominations will be accepted until two weeks before the
  election date. The voting will be open for at least two weeks. To successfully
  gain an appointment as a Voting Member, the nominee must receive at least four
  positive votes, as long as that constitutes a majority of those voting for that candidate.
* The candidate will be informed promptly at the close of voting by a
  Coordination Committee member. If the vote is not affirmative, the
  Coordination Committee will provide feedback to the nominee.

At least one round of voting for adding voting members should be carried out
before the initial election of the Coordination Committee.

Term and Active/Emeritus Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voting Members have no term limits. Voting Members who have stopped
contributing are encouraged to declare themselves as *emeritus*. Those who have
not made any significant contribution for two years may be asked to move
themselves to the *emeritus* category by the Coordination Committee. If no
response is received, the Coordination Committee may automatically change a
Voting Member’s status to *emeritus*. To record and honor their contributions,
*emeritus* Voting Members will continue to be listed. *Emeritus* Voting Members
are not able to participate in votes.
An emeritus member may request to be marked as active at any time if they feel
they are making contributions.

Removing Voting Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the
Voting Members against their will. A vote must be held to remove a Voting
Member. Such a vote is triggered by a motion made by an active Voting Member,
which must be seconded by an additional Voting Member. The vote must conclude
no more than three months after the motion is seconded. Removal requires
approval by two-thirds of all active Voting Members at the time the motion is
made. The motion, second, and vote will be by secret ballot. Removal under this
provision will be reflected by updating the list of Voting Members. A member
removed via this mechanism does not have emeritus status.

It may be necessary for the Ombudsperson and the Coordination Committee to
remove a Voting Member for violations of the Code of Conduct. In this case, the
Coordination Committee and Ombudsperson will work together to make this
decision.

Approving and Modifying This Charter
------------------------------------
This document was submitted following the process in `APE 1`_, and the normal APE
acceptance procedures will be followed. The Coordination Committee at the time
of submitting this APE are all co-authors and therefore will not override any
consensus of the community on accepting the final version.

Changes to this Charter after it has been accepted should follow the
modification process in `APE 1`_, with the exception that the final approval of
the modification requires approval by a two-thirds vote of the
`Voting Members`_ rather than approval by the Coordination
Committee.

Branches and Pull Requests
==========================
N/A

Implementation
==============
This Charter enters into force upon this APE being accepted (see the last
section of the description). At that time the ``GOVERNANCE.md`` file in the
astropy repo should be updated to point to this document.

Backward Compatibility
======================
This Charter supersedes previous un-codified governance understandings, but does
not serve to invalidate the APE process or any other processes or policies that
pre-date it and do not conflict.

Alternatives
============
The Astropy Governance Working Group discussed a wide range of alternatives on
both the broad scope of Project governance and details of this Charter. It is
not practical to summarize that in the text of this APE, but the Working Group's
`running notes <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XsJCQDm1EBWm2w2yDbohWw2HhMAO_-YhnOMhBsNV82I/edit?usp=sharing>`_
provide an excellent starting point for this discussion.

Decision rationale
==================
This APE was the product of several months of discussion by the Astropy
Governance Working Group in early 2020, and was then put to the wider
Astropy community for feedback in October 2020. Following extensive
discussions in `astropy/astropy-APEs#61
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/pull/61>`_, feedback was requested on a
revised version at the end of January 2021 and consensus was deemed
to have been reached by early February.

As specified above, this charter aims to be a living and updatable
document - thus, once the initial voting membership is confirmed,
any parts of the document can be discussed further and amended,
and the present version is just meant to be a starting point.

The APE was formally accepted on 19th February 2021.
